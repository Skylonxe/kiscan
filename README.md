# About (2021)
Kiscan is GUI Framework for Unreal Development Kit (Unreal Engine 3). I released it in March 2014 and since then it was self hosted on my domain. In 2021 I moved it to GitHub to find more persitent place for it. Architecture and the way framework works can be compared to UMG of UE4, although there were significant limitations as there was no C++ access or editor customization in UDK.
As this framework was created quite some time ago, it does not represent my present code quality. All the folowing sections are mostly copied from my self hosted page. Documentation is not complete as at the time of the release of Kiscan, Unreal Engine 4 came out and I moved shortly too. 

### Main pillars
- Utilize Full Power of Kismet: All dynamic actions and events are managed in Kismet. You don't need to touch single line of code.
- Designer Friendly: Good looking and fully functional user interface using just UDK editor.
- Saves You Time: Create high-quality GUI in a few minutes.

### What is Kiscan
Kiscan is GUI framework for Unreal Develoment Kit. It is a tool which allows developers to create fully interactive and dynamic user interface. It offers more than 80 custom UnrealScript classes. It primary focuses on designers, so It requires no programming knowledge. All features are accessible in the Unreal Editor and the Unreal Kismet.

### Why Kiscan
UDK supported only two solutions until the release of Kiscan. First is Scaleform which connects UDK and Flash Professional (costs hundreds of dollars). Second solution is Canvas which is pretty old UnrealScript class usable only by programmers. I made this framework on top of Canvas and added custom algorithms to expose its power to Unreal Editor. Working with Kiscan is fast and reliable because everything is visual and easy to debug. You can create menus, inventories, overlays, cursors or even 2D Games in a few minutes.

### Author
Made by Ondrej Hrusovsky. At the time of Kiscan release (March 2014) I had four years of experience with development in UDK.
